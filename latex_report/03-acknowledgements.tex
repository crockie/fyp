I would like to thank my supervisor, Professor Chng Eng Siong, for his guidance and support throughout this project. His insightful feedback and advice have been instrumental in my learning journey. I am especially grateful for the opportunity to attend an AWS workshop, which significantly enhanced my cloud computing skills. 

I would also like to express my deepest gratitude to my mentor, Vu Thi Ly, whose continuous support and encouragement have been invaluable. Her guidance during our weekly meetings played a crucial role in shaping the direction of this project and ensuring its successful completion. Her prompt responses to my queries and her dedication to mentorship have made this an enriching and fulfilling experience.

Additionally, I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to my past internships at GovTech and the Central Provident Fund Board for providing me with the opportunity to work on various cloud computing projects. The knowledge and hands-on experience I gained from these internships has been instrumental in successfully completing this project.

Finally, I am profoundly grateful to my family and friends for their unwavering support, encouragement, and belief in me. Their constant motivation has been a driving force throughout my academic journey.
